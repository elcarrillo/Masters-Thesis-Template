# Master's Thesis Template

This repository provides a LaTeX template designed by Edgar Carrillo, originally created to meet the thesis formatting requirements for Fisk University's MS in Physics program. By making this template publicly available, I aim to assist others in crafting well-structured master's theses and provide an example framework for academic writing.

## Directory Structure

The template is organized as follows:

- `body/`: Core content of the thesis.
  - `images/`: Directory for storing images used in the thesis.
  - `abstract.tex`: Abstract section.
  - `acknowledgment.tex`: Acknowledgment section.
  - `appendix.tex`: Appendix content.
  - `chapter1_intro.tex`: Introduction chapter.
  - `chapter2_methods.tex`: Methods chapter.
  - `chapter3_results.tex`: Results chapter.
  - `chapter4_discussion.tex`: Discussion chapter.
  - `chapter5_conclusion.tex`: Conclusion chapter.
- `approval_sheet.tex`: Approval sheet template.
- `bibliography.bib`: Bibliography file for managing references.
- `main.tex`: Main LaTeX file for compiling the thesis.
- `preamble.tex`: Pre-defined settings for packages, formatting, and macros.
- `title_page.tex`: Title page template.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each section is stored in its own `.tex` file, simplifying organization and editing.
- **Image Management**: Centralized folder (`body/images/`) for storing and referencing visual content.
- **Standardized Formatting**: Ensures compliance with Fisk University's formatting guidelines through the `preamble.tex` file.
- **Custom Margins**: Margins are defined in `main.tex` using the `geometry` package, based on university requirements.

## How to Use

1. **Edit Content**: Update the `.tex` files in the `body/` directory with your thesis content.
2. **Add Images**: Place your images in the `body/images/` folder and reference them within the chapters.
3. **Compile**: Use a LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf, TeXShop, or VS Code with LaTeX Workshop) to compile the `main.tex` file.
4. **Manage References**: Add your bibliography entries to `bibliography.bib`.

## Notes

- Ensure the title page, approval sheet, and margins align with any specific updates to your institution's formatting requirements.
- Modify `preamble.tex` to add custom packages or adjust settings as needed.

## Acknowledgment

This template includes placeholder text and structure generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. The framework streamlines the process of developing a LaTeX-based thesis while adhering to academic standards.

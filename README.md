# Master's Thesis Template

This repository offers a comprehensive LaTeX template designed by Edgar Carrillo, initially created to meet the thesis formatting requirements for Fisk University's MS in Physics program. The template includes sample figures, references, tables, and logically organized section titles, making it a complete and practical tool for thesis preparation.

By sharing this template publicly, I aim to support students in creating well-structured master's theses and provide a clear framework for academic writing.

## Directory Structure

The template is organized as follows:

- `body/`: Core content of the thesis.
  - `images/`: Directory for storing images used in the thesis.
  - `abstract.tex`: Abstract section.
  - `acknowledgment.tex`: Acknowledgment section.
  - `appendix.tex`: Appendix content.
  - `chapter1_intro.tex`: Introduction chapter.
  - `chapter2_methods.tex`: Methods chapter.
  - `chapter3_results.tex`: Results chapter.
  - `chapter4_discussion.tex`: Discussion chapter.
  - `chapter5_conclusion.tex`: Conclusion chapter.
- `approval_sheet.tex`: Approval sheet template.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each section is stored in its own `.tex` file, simplifying organization and editing.
- **Image Management**: Centralized folder (`body/images/`) for storing and referencing visual content.
- **Standardized Formatting**: Ensures compliance with Fisk University's formatting guidelines through the `preamble.tex` file.
- **Custom Margins**: Margins are defined in `main.tex` using the `geometry` package, based on university requirements.

## How to Use

1. **Open in Overleaf**: The easiest way to work with this template is by uploading the project to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX editor. Follow these steps:
   - Download the repository as a `.zip` file.
   - Log in to Overleaf and create a new project.
   - Choose "Upload Project" and upload the `.zip` file.
   - Edit and compile the `main.tex` file directly in Overleaf.

2. **Edit Content**: Modify the `.tex` files in the `body/` directory with your thesis content.

3. **Add Images**: Place your images in the `body/images/` folder and reference them within the chapters.

4. **Compile Locally**: If you prefer to work locally, use LaTeX editors like TeXShop, VS Code with LaTeX Workshop, or any other editor, and compile the `main.tex` file.

5. **Manage References**: Add your bibliography entries to the `bibliography.bib` file.

## Notes
